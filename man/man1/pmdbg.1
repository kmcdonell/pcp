.TH PMDBG 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdbg\f1 \- report Performance Co-Pilot debug options
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmdbg\f1
[\f3\-l\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The components of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) use
a global mechanism to control diagnostic and debug output.
.PP
.B pmdbg
prints out all the available debug options with
the name of the option and some descriptive text.
.PP
The
.B \-l
option does nothing, but is included for backwards compatibility with older
versions of
.BR pmdbg .
.PP
Most applications using the facilities of the PCP support
a
\f3\-D\f1 \f2name\f1[,\f2name\f1 ...]
command-line syntax to enable debug control using the name(s) of
the desired debug options.
.PP
Alternatively the initial value of the debug control flags may be set
to a comma-separated list if option name(s) 
using the environment variable
.BR $PCP_DEBUG ,
provided the applications
use
.BR pmGetOptions (3)
to process command line options and arguments.
If both mechanisms are used the effect is additive, so the resultant flags are
those set via
.B $PCP_DEBUG
combined with those set via any
.B \-D
command line options.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
