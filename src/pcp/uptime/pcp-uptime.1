.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-uptime
gives a one line display of the following information.
The current time,
how long the system has been running,
how many users are currently logged on,
and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
.PP
When invoked via the
.BR pcp (1)
command, the
.BR \-h /\c
.BR \-\-host ,
.BR \-a /\c
.BR \-\-archive ,
.BR \-O /\c
.BR \-\-origin ,
.BR \-Z /\c
.BR \-\-timezone
and several other
.I pcp options

.PP
When replaying from an archive using the
.BR \-a
option, the required information may not be available at the
default starting time, in which case the reported values will be ``?''.
In this case, use the
.BR \-S
or
.BR \-O
options to move the starting time into a point in the archive
where the required information is available.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-uptime
is inspired by the
.BR uptime (1)
command and aims to be command line and output compatible with it.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
