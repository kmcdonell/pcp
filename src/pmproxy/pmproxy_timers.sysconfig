## Type:        string
## Default:	"-E"
#
# Run the pmlogger_daily script, via pmproxy_daily.service or
# pmproxy_check.service with the given parameters.  Both service units
# are run periodically from their respective timer units.
#
# If PMLOGGER_DAILY_PARAMS is left commented out, the default
# is "-E", which causes pmlogger_daily to continue rather than fail if
# metadata inconsistencies are encountered when merging archives during
# daily log processing, and the default rules apply for culling and
# compression.
#
# Alternatively, these options may be added to PMLOGGER_DAILY_PARAMS ...
#
# For culling old archives
# -k TIME, --discard=TIME
# 		remove archives after TIME (format DD[:HH[:MM]]),
# 		TIME maybe never or forever to prevent culling.
#		[default -k 14:0:0 (14 days)]
#
# For compressing archives
# -x TIME, --compress-after=TIME
#		compress archive data files after TIME (format DD[:HH[:MM]]),
#		TIME maybe 0 (compress as soon as possible) or never (prevent
#		compression) or forever (alias for never).
#		[default is 0 if zstd(1) is installed or xz(1) and
#		the lzma library is installed, else never]
# -X PROGRAM, --compressor=PROGRAM
#		use PROGRAM for archive data file compression
# -Y REGEX, --regex=REGEX
#		grep -E filter for files to NOT compress.
#		[default \.(index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4|zst)$]
#
# pmlogger_daily is ALWAYS run from pmproxy_*.service with an
# additional -Q parameter independent of the value for
# PMLOGGER_DAILY_PARAMS that may be set here.
#
#PMLOGGER_DAILY_PARAMS=""
