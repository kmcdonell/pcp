Title:          Performance Co-Pilot
Version:        @PACKAGE_VERSION@
Entered-date:   @PACKAGE_BUILD_DATE@
Description:    Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a framework and
		services to support system-level performance monitoring
		and management.  It presents a unifying abstraction for
		all of the performance data in a system, and many tools
		for interrogating, retrieving and processing that data.

		PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform
		toolkit supporting both live and retrospective analysis.
		The distributed PCP architecture makes it especially
		useful for those seeking centralized monitoring of
		distributed processing.

		the PCP project visit https://pcp.io
